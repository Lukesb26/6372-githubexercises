I found the Matt Ratto reading very refreshing. He brings a constructionist and almost recreational approach to the act of brainstorming. In the manifestos section of Critical Making, Daniel Charny explores how the “distance between the maker and the user is growing,” and how dependent our society has become on the groups of people who know how to “make.” My question is, do we feel that the “Maker Revolution,” as it is often termed, will introduce more people to the critical making process of using construction itself as an exploratory tool? Can Charny’s gap between makers and consumers be whittled down by proliferating the pre-Google habit of “messing about” with media, for curiosity’s sake, and also to bring new angles to seemingly unrelated problems?
