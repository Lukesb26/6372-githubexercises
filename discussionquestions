I found the Matt Ratto reading very refreshing. He brings a constructionist and almost recreational approach to the act of brainstorming. In the manifestos section of Critical Making, Daniel Charny explores how the “distance between the maker and the user is growing,” and how dependent our society has become on the groups of people who know how to “make.” My question is, do we feel that the “Maker Revolution,” as it is often termed, will introduce more people to the critical making process of using construction itself as an exploratory tool? Can Charny’s gap between makers and consumers be whittled down by proliferating the pre-Google habit of “messing about” with media, for curiosity’s sake, and also to bring new angles to seemingly unrelated problems?

At what point can art be considered adversarial design? Would Ai Weiwei and his works with ancient pottery [1] [2] or his studies on perspective [3] [4] be adversarial design?

The chapter by Malcolm Barnard demonstrated the openness and constructed nature of the term fashion by looking at the origins of the word and the many definitions for the same word. Barnard demonstrates that thinking of fashion merely as clothing is troublesome. “And it could be said that, while all fashion is adornment, not all fashion is clothing. Some fashion is tattooing or cicatrisation” (10). Additionally the lack of a stand-alone definition for the word, or as Barnard states, “Again, there is no stand-alone definition; each of the terms is defined by its relations to the other terms in the structure” (11). Barnard also discusses gender and identity in fashion. These things bring about the question of openness in design and acceptance of a greater umbrella of fashion. What then is the definition of fashion as we are concerned in our projects, also what role does gender play in that project?
