Ratto makes an interesting argument in that through the process of “making” we are given the opportunity to evaluate the “shared acts of making rather than the evocative object” (Ratto, 2011). This allows that the objects themselves are not the end, but rather the benefits found in the process of “making.” The argument is that people are able to gather more insight and develop an appreciation of the task, regardless of the final product. It is by participating in the process that we gain a more intimate knowledge of the subject. In this sense, I have become more open to the projects from a class such as EMAC 6372, because of the potential insight I might gain by participating in otherwise overlooked tasks. I would never have considered taking part in a project that combines fashion and programming, because I would never have considered the applicable educational theories that could be discovered. The initial readings have already enabled me to expand my perception of the social impacts of “fashion.” It is interesting to consider the possibilities of combining the unique perspectives of the social observations of fashion with the details of my personal and professional life.
